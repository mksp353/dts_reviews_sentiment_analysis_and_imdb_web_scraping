Title,Review,Rating
Not a f1 fan but loved this show!,"I've never watched an f1 race and know nothing about the drivers or sport other than its for the rich and famous. I was so surprised at how much I REALLY liked this series. Getting to know the drivers, cars, dirty details, everything. It is so well done. Dont think ill be watching any f1 races in 2019 but will be expectantly waiting for season 2!",10
Made me a Formula 1 Fan,I had never watched an F1 race before. Had no clue of the rules and points based system. Now I feel like I'm the biggest Formula 1 fan. Amazing cinematography. Best racing documentary ever made out there.,10
Binge Worthy,"As a female who has never even held a drivers licence I doubt greatly that I am the F1's target market but for the 2019 that's going to change. This doco series puts a personality into the sport that I often just assumed was bland & full of thugs. Utterly fascinating, it also does (in my opinion) an excellent job of explaining the rivalries between the different company factions. Really hope there will be a season 2.",9
This is returning F1 to me,"Captures all the stuff just outside the headlines of the sport, and goes behind the scenes better than anyone before.Especially interesting to get close to many of the ""smaller"" drivers, as most of us already know all there is to know about Hamilton, Vettel, etc.If you like the NFL Network Gameday productions, you will like this as well - provided you like racing ofcourse :)I'm a fan, after binge watching the first season.",9
Very good production indeed,"It's so good to watch a F1 show that isn't mainly focused on Mercedes and Ferrari.
You really get to see what goes on inside the world of F1 and hear personal stories from the drivers and the teams.
I'd recommend it to every fan of the sport.",10
A real insight,"As a F1 fan, it is very exciting to get a sneak peek behind the scenes, and see what happened in certain situations during last years season. The drivers and their teams show how they really feel about incidents on and off the track. We see the reactions on Haas F1 team, when both cars had to retire from very good positions in the first race of the season, because of errors during pitstops. We also get a better insight to why Daniel Ricciardo decided to sign with a different team for the 2019 season.
This is just a few of the things I like about this documentary series, I recommend you watch it if you are a F1 fan.",10
I love this...,"In the day and age of social media everybody is a 'backseat driver' and wannabe critic, wether positive or negative. So I'm not going to say much in-depth about this mini-documentary.I loved the editing, use of material and insight not normally given into F1. Anyone who likes F1 to a certain extend and is geared up towards the 2019 season will most likely enjoy this as a primer. Anyone who isn't into F1 yet, but has a slight interest should get a good grasp of all the politics, mindgames et al that go on behind the scenes aswell.Liberty Media and Netflix, please do this every year and never mind the critics!10/10 well deserved from me",10
Perfect precursor to the 2019 F1 season,"A really great way of showing the sport from the inside, as well as the several conflicts between teams and drivers that happened during the 2018 season. Good soundeffects in the race and crash scenes gave me goosebumps several times.",10
F1 at its best,"As a fun and even for those who aren't, a must see series.
Very well made and gives an approach of the fastest sports",8
"Nothing Truly Exceptional, But It Made Me a Fan of the Sport for sure.","The most dramatic season in F1 in years and Netflix screwed it up (somewhat). The false commentary throughout annoyed me then just pissed me off! False razzmatazz of what qualifying day is about was just nonsense. There was signs of the original insight you got from the first three brilliant seasons but this just became more and more of a promotional series for the FIA. Some episodes to the same high standards, others just staged and orchestrated.Lando Norris has even complained on Twitter that the editing has painted incorrect pictures of him and Ricciardo by adding remarks made from one race into another to hype it up. That's just poor.",10
F1 on the very best,"As a lifelong F1 fan, the post production commentary is killing this show... Creating fake battles, debates, rivalries loses all grip on reality that this show could, AND SHOULD, have! Some of the sounds effects are just simply wrong, not even using the correct era of cars (sometimes even using V8 era sounds on onboard footage), and even worse due to COVID and everyone using masks, creating dialogues between team bosses or drives, that never actually happened!DTS has footage and access to create AMAZING content, but they decided to create their own storyline... No wonder Max Verstappen doesn't want to be part of this show after season 1, and if they keep this up, I wonder how many other drivers will do the same!",9
"Brilliant series, especially for non F1 fans",I have never really cared for racing other than video games and being American most friends of mine that do like racing are nascar fans. Left turn driving only is boring but I randomly started this show on Netflix and I ended up binging it. It even made me look up f1 schedule on tv and since the first season I watch most races or at least record them. Well done show to see the back story of what's going on in the f1 world.,7
3 brilliant seasons and then this?,"It takes me just 24 hours to see all the 10 episodes. The film is amazing. Definitely i'm prepared for the season, that begins next week! So good luck to all drivers and let the show begins!",2
Get rid of the post production commentary,"As a F1 fan, I really, really liked this serie. It gives such depth to the entire circus that's traveling around the world each and every year. The editing and the sound effects are really strong and give you that immersive feeling of power and speed. Please continue next season, I'm sure you will make a lot of people happy!",10
I watch f1 races now because of this show haha,"Ok. So I used to watch every race, every qualifying, every practice session. Schmacher and Häkkinen were my firsts and that lead to me becoming a hardcore Räikkönen fan.Things change. Things become boring and F1 is heading in that direction. Mercedes dominance is well and good for them but not for the consumer. But this show, brought back memories, interest and an overall appreciation for the sport of F1 again. Well done. May this show long continue.",10
An amazing story!,"Poor, poor Lewis Hamilton, he was robbed of his title. He was picked last for his 3rd grade soccer team simply because all 3rd graders are racist. I feel horrible for him being one of 20, yes, TWENTY F1 drivers in THE WORLD.But I digress... Netflix obviously has to push their narrative with completely out of context reactions, interviews and reactions. Seasons 1 and 2 were exceptional. 3 was clearly not up to par and 4 complete crap. The visuals of the races are great at times when they're not cherry picked.",10
Please continue next year,"Christ almighty. Just no pleasing some people.Thank you Liberty, Netflix and of course F1. Greatest sport and spectacle on the planet. Any chance of the same for next near?",10
Back In,"(Flash Review)This was a really good in-depth look at some significant on track battles, driver and team insights and challenges throughout the 2018 season. Less technical and more emotional. There are veteran teams struggling, drivers fighting to keep their seat with new younger drivers aiming to make their mark and really good insights into what is really happening between the midfield teams that are often overlooked with Ferrari and Mercedes as dominating teams. The footage is high quality with F1 Insiders adding their thoughts. It was all edited to cover various moments from teams and drivers while also moving through the season. Overall, this was very engaging for big F1 fans and hopefully if they do this again Ferrari and Mercedes participate.",10
Pushing the narrrative,"Clearly aimed at new or casual fans, it's good entertainment and helps see the life of F1 drivers from the inside, but it makes some things up and some scenes are from races that have nothing to do with what's being shown in the episode.",9
Fascinating insight. Thank you,"Loved season 1, got hooked, and so well produced, you felt the speed of the car sitting in your chair, ace!Season 2 still very good, still fresh
Season 3 also good... although the focus on stable bosses became a bit much, and the not following races in chronological order...Season 4 starts with a full forced episode 1 but you already know the story that red bull will win by a technicality at the end... and then they keep on focusing on the stable bosses. I can't stand that Horner guy anymore showcasing his english house and spicegirl wife, he thinks he's as important as the drivers, yada yada. I gave up on episode 2. No more!",8
Deep Insider Insights; Non-Technical,"As long F1 fan, this is nice for back stage footage, but absolutely terrible as doc. Fake narratives, fake sound effects, driver mics put in different times. Weirdly cut where it doesn't make sense. The fake commentator. He's talking about a lap and the cars are in totally different place on track, Missed ton of stuff. But the fake drama is just bad.Get some proper directors and editors that know F1. Stop creating fake stuff, 2020 season was perfect with a lot of drama. Instead you skipped most of it and created made up stories.",8
Cool,"Netflix makes up a lot of things and are biased. Go watch 2021 season and then DTS, then YOU will feel robbed from reality.Examples:
They depicts mazepins sochi result as a great achievement. He finished ahead of his teammate and latifi. They both DNF'ed.... and he finshed 18th...They picture Hamilton as a clean racer and a victim of Max's driving style. But Hamilton is just as ruthless as Max. You cant be a 7x champion and be inocent little puppy....DTS is ridiculous and far from the reality.",6
3 good seasons then crap!,"The style and way this series is presented is truly remarkable simply because I never thought there could be a show that would interest me so much that I would start watching and following any form of racing. Now I'm waking up early on the weekends to watch the qualifiers and racing haha. I don't know the history of F1 ratings or general world interest, but this series has to have created a huge new interest in the sport. I truly hope they keep making the series every season.",1
Get some new editors and directors,Simply amazing show. Binged watched both series and now am looking forward to watching the 2020 season then the netflix show later. Netflix should do the same with the PGA . I love shows that put context to sport like this. Truly a great great piece of entertainment and sports documenting.,10
Fake and manipulating,"Formula One: Drive to survive.I'm not really a fan of Formula One although I love cars.
On TV the races never really gripped me.
However this Netflix documentary is absolutely fantastic.
I decided to give this a go because I wanted to give my Home Cinema system a workout and this show is shot in 4K with Dolby Atmos sound.
Wow Netflix!!!
This is by far the best thing I've seen on Netflix in terms of picture and sound quality. More on that later.The actual documentary follows a group of F1 teams throughout the 2018 season. This show is very exciting. The production values are astonishing. This is how Formula One should be seen.
The races in particular are excellent as we are exposed close up to the pressures of running a F1 team.
It's nice to get to know the man behind the wheel and those working tirelessly to keep him and the car on the track.In terms of the picture quality this show is sublime. It's 4K crisp with colours of the cars and environment popping out of the screen. Detail is spellbinding. This is unbelievable picture quality regarding that this is streaming content.
If the image quality is good then the sound will actually go through your roof.
If you do have a Dolby Atmos set up then be sure to crank it up way passed eleven.
This is the best Atmos track available on Netflix.
I would even go so far to say it rivals some Blu-ray Discs I own.
Every speaker works overtime and with the volume at a high you will think that an F1 car is about to go through your living room.
This is the best utilisation of height channels that I have heard yet!
Engine sound and instructions from the pit can be heard from above.
The use of spacial effects are exemplary. The soundstage is magnificent as cars pass from one speaker to another.
Usually height channels come in to use rather sparsely. Not here!
You'll be ducking for cover!
Bass is delicious. You would not guess that this is compressed streamed content.
My Subwoofer would almost leap from its seated position with every crash and collision.
Not everyone can afford to be there at a real F1 race but this show puts you very close to the action.
This is a superbly made documentary that looks, sounds and feels that it's been made with the money of a successful F1 teams budget for the season.Very impressive!",9
Not a racing fan but I now watch F1 regularly,"Here you have it all. nobody is holding back, swearing words flying everywhere, directors, team leaders, drivers pissed of one to another, remorse, hate, jealousy, friendship, team spirit, depression, the complete blend of what Formula 1 is all about, showing that it is much more than a fast-paced sport. I deeply recommend this to anyone who has not seen it yet, fantastic show.",9
Not a F1 fan but fast becoming one,"I feel like when a season has more content, this series' quality deteriorates proportionally. They could've had so many good stories, but decided to spend an entire episode on Haas (or even worse Mazepin). No mention of the amazing defense of Alonso against Hamilton in Hungarian GP. Perez's Abu Dhabi defense got 30 seconds? After this season, I'll probably stop watching DTS. I am not getting anything interesting from this show.I am keeping 8-star rating, because I really enjoyed the first two season's and decided watch F1 again after like 10 years. However, if you followed the entire 2021 season, you are not missing much by not watching the last season.",8
This is the best looking and sounding content on Netflix,"This was intended (by Liberty Media) to attract the new globalist youngster to the Formula 1 Phenomenon... I don't mind, since F1 will be more on TV and not only on that website... still some Cable TV providers don't think F1 is important for people to see those super professional drivers at work... still, for CTVP important are cooking shows and other garbage...",9
Uncensored explicit Formula 1.,"Absolutely fantastic series
I wasn't into F1 at all before I watched this. I am now. Pure brilliance.",10
Deteriorating Quality,"For F1 fans, this is the ultimate behind the scenes. It's so raw, full of mind-blowing politics that goes on behind the door. Absolutely brilliant. The production is on point, interview and cut scenes are so specified, just mind-blowing for someone who watches F1 and wants to go deeper into the understanding of the teams.",10
Marketing,I'm not a huge fan of Formula 1 but this was absolutely gripping. It builds and creates multiple layers of stories not just from the best team and drivers but the lower ranks where its just as interesting learning about the politics and drama of F1 racing. The races are condensed into a thrilling narrative to rival any drama. I would really recommend this if you are interested in any sport regardless of F1. This is the best way of catching up on the F1 season in my opinion!,9
Top notch,"Whilst season 1 and 2 thoroughly deserved a rating of 9/10 from me, S3 had already seen a decline due to the fake commentary, misplaced audio, interviews and artificial rivalry. Unfortunately S4 of DTS takes all of that to an extreme and adds more. There are so many genuinely amazing and intense moments of the crazy 2021 season uncovered, while we're forced to watch staged interviews or top teams' PR stunts. No mention of Kimi retiring after the longest ever F1 career, no mention of the Norris drama in Sochi. No coverage of the fantastic battle between Hamilton and Alonso in Hungary, which was paramount for Ocon to win the race. Instead we watch Yuki talk about his poo. Out ot sync engine noise (flat out in chicanes, decelerating on the straights) etc, I could go on.F1 and Netflix must change the approach. Show us more behind the scenes stuff. Genuine moments and look into the life of F1 teams. Prioritise the already exciting reality over prefabricated moments. That's why S1 and S2 were so successful.",7
Absolutely brilliant!,"This series has made a great job of drawing new fans to Formula 1. However it is a really inaccurate depiction and frustrating experience to watch for anyone who follows the sport seriously. Radio messages that are spliced and often completely taken out of context, narratives that are completely fabricated, focus on things that are completely irrelevant to the season. There are just so many flaws that even giving it four stars feels generous.",4
Wow! edge on the seat viewing,"The show captures the essense of Formula 1. The rivalry between the teams and the financial problems that comes with it. I am very upset and dissapointed about the wrongly used video messages along with made up rivalries but as the source that got me interested in Formula 1, this series cannot get a lower than 9 from me.",9
Mixed Feelings - Needs Change,"As soon as you watch first episode you cannot stop there. Formula 1 fan or not, you should watch it for amazing production.Hope they are working on second season too.",9
Not for F1 fans,"Very little of Hamilton and Vettel, this series shines a light on the mid and back of pack teams, the personal battles to hold their seats and the teams fighting for Constructor points. Watching the TV feeds on Sunday you miss a lot of this. Lots of slow motion crashes, cursing and serious managers. Good series to get more into the racing, as focussing on the Mercedes team constant success at the front is too limiting.",10
Pretty Good,How can one talk about Formula 1 without the two top dogs of the competition?,8
Netflix finally strike documentary gold,I wasn't into F1 at all before watching this . It's nice to learn what goes on behind the scenes and how much prep and work the drivers have to do . Once you've watched one episode your hooked,8
Brilliant series. Great story telling with sound editing to match it.,"Over the years my interest in F1 has somewhat faded, the predictable results boring races and the never ending politics.What I really enjoyed was the series focused on the teams in the middle and back of the grid where every point gained is meet with as much joy as the winning teams.
F1 can be a brutal business with just 20 seats up for grabs, and a cue of young aspiring drivers desperate to get the chance of a drive.Despite there undoubted wealth you can sense genuine emotion and pain when a driver knows he has not performed well to retain his drive. This is a side of F1 we don't normally see on TV when the drivers team owners give there usual post race interviews. 9/10",9
Great look at the midfield,"All you need to become F1 fan, which I must emphasise I never been. But, after watching this show, I truly am. It's got everything insight, history and thrill.",9
9 stars coz no Hamilton and Vettel,"Really Awful... this is F1 to you? The entire documentary it was about gossips and eye for an eye. Last year we watched the best Championship ever and yet the creators of this awful thing chose to make a show who reminds ""Big Brother"" (Remind you that the world champion of 2021 Max Verstappen refused to speak as well -after he watched season 1-) Doesn't deal with the racing part almost at all. Definitely it has choosed side and this is something really frustrating and unacceptable. And... omg 😲... where are the rest of the drivers of the grid???? At least 10 of 20 drivers are missing! World champions like Fernando Alonso!Again... Awful 😖
If I could give 0 points I would!",10
Very good,"I've been a huge fan of the show since the very first episode, and I just love how well the drama around the tracks is told. They could've erased all the F1 footage and still have a superb production, because the storyline is absolutely fantastic. If it was scripted it couldn't have been any better. But this is real life, real drivers, real events, real make or break stories, real lay offs of real drivers when they're as bad as ""only"" being at 11-20 of the best F1 drivers in the world. It's very emotional at times and I find myself sobbing at times. Even my wife who doesn't care one bit for motor sports sat there crying and said ""let him win, please let him win"".
The extra dimension of the series is recognizing almost every track they're on, since I've also always loved racing on the computer, and now I play Real Racing om my phone. That makes it even more exciting.
Thank you Netflix, from the bottom of my heart, thank you, for producing the highlight of the year, for the last three years.",6
Surprisingly good,"Every season was amazing to watch.. thank you Netflix for releasing this and the drivers / principles and teams for such fantastic and honest stories. I am now a huge Lewis Hamilton and Valtteri Bottas fan, what amazing professionals. I cannot wait for the next but until it releases, I'm going to watch the races now.",1
F1 in a nutshell,"This production manages to find interesting stories in a sport that has been boring for so many years. That's quite a feat.Formula 1: Drive to survive totally leaves out the race for the championship, because it is no race at all with Mercedes being so dominant. It's sad that it has to do that, but it's a very intelligent decision. The stories of 2nd and 3rd tier teams like Renault, Haas and Alfa Romeo are way more enticing. The production also highlights some of the lesser known drivers that might be up and coming.All in all a very compelling series that is not about the winning team.",10
Does not do justice to the sport. Formula 1 deserves better.,"I never watched formula 1. Only saw it on the news. However this Netflix series really drags you into the sport. It's done in such a way where you truly get to know the inner parts of the sport. It makes it very interesting and you end up showing a lot of respect to the engineers, crew and the drivers. So much effot goes into this.The series is like watching the races in fast forward with drama.",10
Just horrible..,"It is not a series aimed at the audience that follows Formula 1 closely. It does not have a regular and flowing plot, and has an incredibly amateur narrative style. The biggest disgrace is that in the 3rd season, not even a single image or word of the best race of the season, the race in Turkey where Hamilton declared the championship, was included. It can be taken a look at for those who want to learn general information about Formula 1, but overall it is an empty series. It seems like a waste of time to me. Can you watch it? Yes, of course, those who are passionate about racing can watch it. Then, have a good time watching it.Well.",9
Racing and drama,"This F1 documentary is extremely intense. Each episode is gripping and draws attention to the intricacies of Formula 1 racing. Everything from losing weight 2 hours before the Singapore Grand Prix, to the perilous collisions, never knew F1 could be this heated. Definitely sparked my interest in F1!",10
Completely New To F1.. Now Very A Big Fan Of F1,"Season 6 seems a little flat compared to previous years, but still a great show to see some of the behind-the-scenes action in F1. Considering that Red Bull dominated the season, the only drama they were able to dwell on was the battle for second place in the constructor's championship. I was surprised that they didn't spend much time on the poor performance of Checo Perez, and all the speculation that came along with that during the season. The contrived and manipulated in-race ""coverage"" and out-of-context radio messages are annoying. However, the greatest disappointment that really tainted this season was the incomprehensible decision to trot out Danica Patrick for commentary. A rodeo clown who had been kicked in the head one too many times would have been a better choice.",8
Captivating,"Season 6. It's not as bad as some of the reviews on here make it out to be. The Williams/Haas episode is great. As is the one on McLaren. Nothing wrong with the episode on De Vries/Ricciardo. Or the one on Alpine and the relationship between their drivers is boring, but that happens. The Toto / Hamilton episode is mostly cringworthy. As is the Aston Martin one.The few bits of insight into the media spin of McLaren and Mercedes and the driver's non-verbal reaction to that are a highlight! But.... the elephant in the room is the missing episode on Red Bull. And thus, the story of the season (records broken left and right) is completely missing from this series. Which is a big negative for me.Perez's brilliant start and then slump, Max's turnaround after a disappointing start.. none of it. Seems like an alternative reality. Too bad. That episode should have been made.",10
Never watched formula 1. But this is a masterpiece.,"To begin with, season 1-3 was absolutely amazing.But Season 4 is bad. Very bad. There is no ""real"" chronological order that's easy to follow.Jumping back and forth between the same races multiple times. Like Bahrain, and Monaco.Seeing Leclerc's gearbox fail in 3 episodes gets boring really fast. Etc, etc.Not to mention the bias against RedBull. I myself is a huge Mercedes fan. But the bias never ends and it gets annoying tbh. Seeing the interviews with Christian Horner, Susie & Toto Wolff every 5 minutes is just frustrating.DTS should have kept the same format as Season 1-3. Following 1 team for 2 races per episode.",8
well,"This is exactly what F1 needed. Thanks to Netflix I am a returning fan after having stopped watching F1 mid 2000s'What I like the most about this TV show is that you actually get to know the drivers, principals, how they feel and how much pressure they go through.It is an incredible competitive doco/drama and very glad they managed to get Mercedes and most teams onboard. You'll see Hamilton quite a fair bit as well as RedBull.Thanks F1 for agreeing to be filmed for Netflix!!!",8
A high intensity sports documentary..,"What a great docu series. I fell out of love with f1 a few years ago as I felt it had gotten boring , but this behind the scenes series focusing on a few key drivers and teams managers is gripping and superb and I will watch the F1 again with renewed focus. Well done netflix ! This is excellent stuff",7
Season 6,"I have never been interested in Formula 1, but I got addictive to this show. Getting to know the business, knowing the teams and getting to know the drivers. Seeing the struggles and what's going on behind the scenes was very interesting. And every episode ending with a race makes you almost feel your one with the drivers. Just simply amazing, can't wait til next season comes out!",1
Top-Quality Sports Documentary,"Stumbled upon this series in season one on a recommendation from another non racing fan. Binge watched it and became obsessed. Such a great series and captures the emotion, egos and drama perfectly! Love this series and can't wait till next year!",10
"Nice, but for the elephant in the room. (or more accurately, the red bull)","I'm a female that has never watched formula 1 previously. I watched all 3 seasons over the weekend.I enjoyed it immensely.You begin to understand, the teams, rivalries and before long you'll find yourself screaming cheering on a certain driver.I'm a total fan now! 😂 Enjoy!!!!",10
"S1-3 was great. S4 was biased, and out of context.","Wow what's this? 58-year-old female with no car interest whatsoever, if it's not electrical, gets hooked on this series? Well, they must have done a good job then right? And, they have! This is absolutely amazing. I've learned so much so I'm gonna watch the 2021 formula 1 series on cable this year. It's exciting, informative and you get it all: blood, sweat and tears. And, for sure, you get your favourites to cheer on.",10
Incredible and Sensational,"Never had interest in F1 of any kind and watched this on recommendation of family who are F1 fans. So I said why not. My god I'm addicted, what goes on behind the scenes, the highs and lows of the drivers and their teams. So much goes in to every race and what struck me is so much musical chairs with drivers if not performing straight away. It's a tough tough business but so much respect to the teams on the whole.. love it and yes I sat down watched my first F1 yesterday. ADDICTED Now.",10
Wow,Outstanding series. It is entertaining and engaging from both a technical perspective of the sport and the personalities involved. I will be watching F1 racing.,9
I got addictive!!,Do yourself a little favour and watch this. It's truly an excellent piece of work.,10
Zero interest in F1- but WOW,"Loved the first 2 season but new from season 3 and forward it is no good. In season 5, Vettels departure is not mentioned. A for time World Champion just ignored. A man who has been one of the most significant driver for the last 15 years, just ignored. Thats a f#@ing scandal.Lots of focus on all the wrong battles and lacking of structure. Change directors/producers and start over. As a fan of F1 for 40+ years this is not F1, this is reality-tv at its worst. Cant belive these guys made one of the best sport documentry of all times, Senna.Start over, get some dedicated and skilled people back and just start over...",10
Brilliant,This show really puts you behind the scenes and in the drivers' seats.Try to see it in full HD and surround sound if you can!,10
The thrill!,"I never watched a Formula 1 race beforehand or had any interest in it whatsoever, but this series really transformed me into a huge fan!",6
Addicted,"I wouldn't be surprised if F1 fan base increases because of this series.Classy, dramatic and exciting.",3
New F1 fan,"I love this series and have seen every episode. Season 4 seems to really highlight the complete lack of emotional intelligence and self awareness of Mercedes leadership and Red Bulls. They both come across as total douche bags. The on again, off again face diapers of drivers and management is laughable.",9
Probably the best series ever,"We were hooked from start to finish. We didn't know anything about F1 - the drivers, how it works, the politics, the money, the danger. But this series is so well produced that it shows you a real in-depth look at F1. Now we know all the teams and the drivers we're F1 fans and can't wait for the rest of the 2021 races!",9
"Season 5, what a disappointment...","Super addictive show
I got hooked on F1 thanks to thisGreat editing and storytellingMy only issue is that they are a full season behind
So anyone can just read the results without watching
This show would be so much better if it was released the day or week of the race.",9
"Fine PR tool, but understand that it does NOT teach you about F1; over-dramatization is fine I guess, but completely made up stories and facts are not","Not a season review, it is only about Spa, British, Monza and Sakhir GP.",8
Excellent 3 seasons!,I can't believe they managed to make something so boring out of the most amazing F1 season. I've been waiting for the premiere for months and I can't believe this. Checo Pérez has 30 seconds on the season and Tsunoda has a whole chapter. WTF seriously... no disrespect but who cares about Tsunoda? I can't believe this.,8
Great series,"Its funny how perfectly tactful constructive criticism of 'Black Panther' gets taken down 3 times in a row, but I write ""unbelievably gay"" about formula 1 and imdb doesnt care at all. This was a test.",9
Brilliant,"Whether you're an F1 fan or not, this series is amazing! There is so much going on in the F1 world.. so much drama and competition this series captures it all in such an entertaining way! Would highly recommend watching it!",9
F1 > NASCAR,"Valtteri Bottas' eyes are incredibly beautiful!! The cameraman did a superb job! I secretly hope that one day he will be in a film or drama...
Both his unwavering belief in himself and his qualities as a driver are admirable, in him opinion. I was so engrossed in the third episode that I couldn't move on to the next one.I love the DTS. Despite the adaptations, this is a great series that makes Formula One more accessible. How many people who weren't interested in Formula One have changed their view of it after watching the DTS? I think that's fantastic and it shows the success of the series. Everything comes from an opportunity!I'll be even happier if we see more Bottas in the next season!",9
Douchebaggery in Face Diapers,"Whether you are a die-hard formula 1 fan or someone who has never heard of formula 1 before, I think you will highly enjoy this show.",7
"I never knew a thing about F1, now I know everything!",This series made me a F1 fan what else is there to say!!!,5
"Meaningless lives, useless goals, but good entertainment.","This show would be so much better if it had a strong narrator. I guess the creators never watched ""Hard Knocks"" and how much Liev Schreiber adds to a sports documentary, giving you the necessary background and scope on what you are seeing.",9
This show needs to be released at real time,Really enjoyed seeing everyone as they really are. One question. Why oh why do Williams carry on? They will lose George as a driver if they cannot give him a decent car. Then what? I think it's really time they gave up.,9
Terrible 3. Season,"It's showed non fans why it isn't just cars going round in a circle and Hamilton winning every race. But they have made some of the moments out to be more dramatic then they actually are by using a clip from one lap, commentary from a different lap and then radio messages from another completely different lap. If you're thinking of watching it, then by all means do, it's a good way of getting into it, but don't take it too literal.",10
So disappointed on season 4,"Season 4 acts as a podcast for the british establishment. Will Buxton loses all credibility.Awful protagonism for Lando Norris, George Rusell, Lewis Hamilton, Valtteri Bottas and Daniel RicciardoYou only hear Mercedes side of the Story.Season 2021 had so much potential for an excelent season, im really dissapointed.Definitely not watching season 5.",10
Unbelievably Gay. (Relax and just read it),"I love this show. Seasons 1-4 were excellent, I gave it a rating of 10 and have seen them like 4 times!!! I became a fan of formula one and have watched every race live from the last 2 F1 race seasons. Unfortunately, season 5 of DTS has been a huge disappointment. First, need more episodes, there are more races and a lot of content to cover. Second, some MAJOR moments were not covered at all and DTS WASTED an ENTIRE episode on Yuki Tsunoda, with too much of his childish behavior. I struggled to stay interested in season 5 because it was so boring. This show has brought F1 to the attention of America and we love it. Netflix, please do better with season 6.",10
Brilliant behind the scenes!,My personal opinion season 5 is one of the best seasons so far. Still a bit to dramatic but I think they have learned from the critical reactions over the past seasons. The dramatics is imho not to hindering like past seasons.I think season 5 is pretty good for newcomers to the formula 1. Without giving spoilers. For veterans it has a bit behind the scenes footage that I found interesting.Overall. Season 5 gives a more honest and realistic review about the formula 1 than past seasons. Perhaps the previous boycot from Verstappen helped in that way.1 tiny complaint; the image footage overall seems a bit to dark.,10
LOVE IT!,"Not only is this one of the finest filming I have seen in a docu-series, Formula 1: Drive to Survive holds and even heightens the excitement of Formula 1. I haven't watched Formula 1 in about 7 years and thought because of that this series wouldn't appeal to me. Little did I know this fantastic show would make me more excited for the upcoming 2019 season that I will forsure be watching. What a ride and what a show 10/10 would recommend.",10
The beauty in Valtteri Bottas' eyes also shows his inner beauty.,"I used to watch f1 as a kid but then stopped. Now I came back to watch this and found myself loving it again. It does a really good job getting you to feel the pressure the drivers, the team and the companies have to go through to be in this extremely exclusive sport.",8
Awesome Look Into Formula 1,"I really enjoyed watching this one. To see at least a glimpse of how hard is to be successful in F1 and struggle of underdogs and financially inferior teams to compete against Ferrari and Mercedes. At first I was really disappointed because Ferrari and Mercedes didn't want to be a part of this, but now I'm glad because entire series would probably be about them. But it's really sad to see that everything is about money. Money comes first, and talent second unfortunately. I really felt sorry for Esteban Ocon and how he was pushed out from Force India because of Lawrence Stroll and Carlos Slim. He showed so much in 2018 and deserved the seat, but who cares if he doesn't bring money into the team. On TV you don't get the whole picture of what is going on in the back and you can't see the amount of pressure that these guys has to put up with. Every mistake, every crash, every bad decision could be your last and to be replaced with another driver is easier than we all think. Only few have the privilege to make mistakes and not feel the consequences. If you like motosport you're gonna like this one.",7
Before watching this Formula 1 was just another sport I didnt watch but...,I would watch this just for the visuals. Omg this makes my 4K tv worth it. Besides that - never been a huge F1 fan. However after a friend recommended this I am digging it. Great production. Great filming. Great story lines. Great racing.,3
This show would be so much better if...,The Formula 1: Drive to Survive series is an F1 fans dream thing to watch. It gives a real insight into what goes on behind the scenes off the track. It gives you exclusive viewing access into some factories of the Formula One teams.Formula 1: Drive to Survive really fits the term 'documentary' as it documents the season in a race by race format. The codes and conventions of sports documentary's are clearly shown in this series. POV shots are used to good effect as it shows the racing from the drivers onboard camera of their car.If you are massively into Formula One I would absolutely recommend this series to you.,10
A lot of insight.,When you finish watch it you will not stop asking for the begining of the racing season,10
Overdramatised but good.,"Ive enjoyed the first seasons of DTS, yes, it has always had that component of drama but always appealing to truthfulness, this season they just decided to make stuff up for the sake of a poor written drama, and as an F1 fan that makes me sick. More of a fiction than a documentary series.",10
Really biased show,"They will tell you that Drive to Survive is a show that brings to you the behind the scenes of Formula 1. That is not true, drive to survive manufactures narratives and creates bias against other drivers. It is a tool used to spread toxicity and further narratives. The aim of the show is to promote F1 through hatred and toxicity. Should be cancelled.",9
Seasons 1-4=AMAZING but Season 5=BORING,A great binge fest. Gets right to the nitty gritty. Well done Netflix. Let's have more of this kind of fly on the wall series. Couldn't wait for the next episode. The highs the lows the drama the politics it's all here.You have to feel for the teams at the back of the grid. The professionalism and strength to keep going is admirable. The pressures on everyone is mind boggling but the rewards are high. A great insight to the drivers and teams.Huge respect. How anyone can be negative about this series is beyond me. Good luck to all for the upcoming season 2024. Let's hope for a nail biting finish. 5 stars.,10
Season 5 (2022) aired in feb 2023 so much better,...the lack of Mercedes and Ferrari coverage; they declined to participate but will be part of 2019.,10
Holy Moly what a ride,"The commentary becomes a joke because the guy who used to commentate on some motorsport who does a lot of the race commentary in season 2 and has obviously been added afterwards sounds like he is commentating in the 70's or 80's through ancient equipment! The attempt to make it sound like actual race commentary has been an absolute failure, 70's & 80's commentary sounds clearer in fact. Only one other major fault and that is the fact they make some of the coverage look and sound so cheesy, just leave the sky F1 commentary as the sole commentary and don't add commentary afterwards and try to make it seem like that was what everyone's main focus was at the time and stop making it sound like a budget 80's Murray Walker and take some of the cheesiness out of some of the coverage and it would make something that is very good into something exceptional in my opinion.",9
Made me like f1 again,"Just love this series. Fast, interesting, lots of action, interesting characters. Big highs and low lows. Great background look into the whole Formula 1 scene. This series even got the wife (and she hates any sport) into racing. It has given us all a great insight into the whole thing. Keep up the great work!!",9
Really good!,This is such a brilliant docu-series. They have done a great job with the story-telling and this certainly makes this entertaining to watch even though the actual sport might not be as entertaining.,6
Hooked,"This is the type of docuseries that you need to see every year.From the start in Melbourne to end in Abu Dhabi ,this sport keeps on flabergasting its every viewer.",1
Would 100% recommend,Netflix have gone totally overboard with the made up drama and tensions they show in the series.Friends are shown as rivals. This is done by editing and clipping certain parts. Also they have failed to show the real battles and rivalries that have happened in the last season (4).They have just pushed it too far with all the fake radio messages and edited footage of races to make it look interesting.,10
Love F1? This is for you!,"I am watching Formula 1 for a few years now, but this is the first time I really get to see the pressure and problems teams and drivers have to go trough. This series gives us a real inside view of F1 and will even be interesting for people not watching F1. This will change my whole F1 watching experience next season.",10
Best Racing TV Series out there!,Its a very interesting show. Definitely a must watch if you are into sports.,10
Season 4 is a disaster,Just amazing...gives you a perspective of not only F1....but competitiveness what life has to offer,10
Don't bother,"Even though I am not an F1 fan, yet I loved the entire series, and in fact, I have become fond of F1. Since I have watched this documentary, I am following F1 and enjoy it a lot.It's not just about what happens on the race track but also what happens behind the scenes. The rivalry, support, heart-breaks, competition etc. I think the name is very appropriately given, ""Drive to Survive"".Watch it even if you are not an F1 fan and stick to it for a while!",10
F1 Fan's wet dream,"Having stopped watching F1 for the past 4 or 5 seasons due to the boring predictability, I found this documentary a great eye-opener to how exciting the midfield can be even when the podium is always the same.This docu-series really shows the inner workings of the smaller teams and managed to get me rooting for drivers I previously paid no attention to. I'll certainly be watching F1 again this season now and if it's the same old podium I'll be able to find excitement in the midfield battle knowing the drivers and teams that little bit more. With the added excitement of a lot of new young drivers I'm sure we'll be in for a killer season.",10
Not to reviewers lamenting...,"Its even interesting for people new to the p
Sport",10
I took the time to find somewhere to review this series,I am now a big F1 fan after watching this. Loved the behind the scenes and the stress in the driver's. Millions of dollars at stake . Loved it,10
Lack of sky commentary in season 2,"The series is more entertaining for non F1 fans/new F1 fans, compared to lifelong fans. Many rivalries shown are fabricated and pretty much everything in the series is shown out of context and doesn't make sense chronologically. However it has produced some pretty iconic moments and I like that it attracts more fans to the sport.",6
Absolutely Fantastic!,You can only rate this show high if you don't have watched F1 before or the GP's of the season or have no Idea about F1 at all.No wonder Verstappen don't wanna be part of it. This show just telling so much lies it's unbelievable.When you remember the GP's you can just shake your head when you see what Netflix is making out of it. Best example in Season 4 Episode 4 where they make Mazepin appear like a hero cause he decided to pit early in Russian GP and showing him with dramatic music overtaking some cars in rain.For people who didn't watched this race or have no memories it will look like he made a bold move and was driving good.In Fact: He was unlapped already by everyone and had NOTHING to lose or to win. So he decided to box for rain tires before everyone else and was able to overtake some cars who overlapped him already. He finished last place. Netflix didn't mentioned anything of that. When you just watch the show you think he ended up at place 12 or sth🤣🤣Another ridiculous disappointment is that this show has just 10 Episodes in one of the most intense and exciting seasons ever but wasting 2!! Episodes for pre season testing and first GP of the year!? And another full episode as mentioned for the worst team of the year!No matter who the manager of this show is needs to get fired!,2
Each episode follows a different good story,"Watching this on a wide screen with a good audio set up makes all the difference. Really well shot, immersive programme. I love the way it draws you into the smaller and less obvious challenges in F1 racing that people who don't frequently watch the sport would miss. I will definitely be following the 2019 series now that I have finished this!",8
Was a fan of F1 but now a bigger fan,"Have been an F1 fan since about 1998, and I believe this series can turn even the most unethused motorsport hater into a lover of Formula 1. It is raw, honest, and uncensored. Exactly what we miss seeing on TV. Bring on season 2!",10
Can now access F1!,"This is a fascinating look behind the scenes of Formula 1. It shows never before seen interactions Red Bull and Renault about engines and drivers. It goes behind the scenes of Haas, Red Bull, Renault, Force India, McLaren, Williams & Sauber dealing with all the ups and downs of the season. It is a must watch for all F1 fans.",10
Could be so much better,"I have been an F1 fan for over 10 years and thought this series should have been there for the fans 10'years ago ! There is so much drama and strategy plots behind the scene ... A series really done as nicely as this really brings it all out.There was always the drama, but when depicted in a well documented series is just ...... a masterpiece.",9
Too much made up drama. Does not show a realistic image of the F1 sports.,"Where are Ferrari and Mercedes???
Love all the episodes, and (being Dutch) all about Verstappen offcourse. But miss the background of the numbers 1 and 2.",8
"Great start, but much room for improvement",Never watch F1 but now I am a fan and gonna watch all the races from now on,10
An unseen view of Formula 1,"This gripping tv series is perfect for a new fan of F1 like myself but I couldn't for the life of me remember the names of the Toro Rosso drivers or Alfa Romeo. They just didn't show all the drivers. I get that it's less exciting to describe all the drivers individually and giving them a back story each, but for me, I wanted to know about each driver and why I should root for them in the championship. it also felt like we were watching the midfield battles and not the top battles which is understandable with Hamilton so dominant, but at least show us the Mercedes drivers. Hopefully next season we will see the Ferrari - Mercedes battle in its full glory. Overall, the season was good, with good production quality so I am looking forward to watching next season.",10
Amazing,So gripping. I'm not a F1 fan but I loved this. Wanted it to go on for at least another 10 episodes. Great narrative. Cool to hear the conversations between the driver and the team during the race. I live the focus and the rivalry and heritage. Bring on series 2 🤞,10
Super duper,"Season 1&2 ok, season 3 not that great. Please return to the basics because the same race discussed 3 times and misleading cuts is not the way to go.By the way, Floyd event narrated that way when we have the full video of what happened it's EXTREMELY disingenuous.",6
It's thrilling!,"I had stopped watching Formula 1 for many years, as I was bored of always same teams winning and very little action in terms of overtaking and too much strategy. Then, I bing-watched this documentary and now I cannot wait for the 2019 season to start. The things that I had found boring became the ones that this documentary has made me love: the midfield and slowest cars fighting to gain just a few points, the immense and dedicated work that goes into the preparation of each race, the strategies to try to be just a bit faster than the opponent drivers, and then the personal stories, which bring a lot of humanity to this sport and makes it enjoyable from a totally different perspective.
Please Netflix never stop producing this show.",2
Welcoming me back to F1,"Season 4 was a real drag. I only managed to watch it because of how good seasons 1, 2 and 3 were. In season 4 too many times I found myself thinking this is BORING. The show seemed to focus more on the drama than the actual racing. Very disappointing.",9
Its fantastic,"Wonderful program, I knew nothing about formula 1 and am now a fan for life! Must watch!",10
Loved it,"As someone who has never really watched a Formula 1 race, wow, what a docu-series. The visuals are something out of an amazing pop-action film and the drama is something that makes you feel for each character. Being a bystander, I feel as though I may have watched one episode and said, ""Oh, that was cool, now let me put on an early 2000's cherished war film,"" but then it turns around and hits me with more. I can't praise this enough, well done by the film and editing crew. There were moments like I watching a Mission Impossible film where it took the actors and crew months to perfect certain scenes. They truly made me skip out on my Sunday routine of watching film noir, or 70's gangster films to watch a 10-episode series on a sport I have never once watched in my life and made it riveting. If you enjoy high action, political/emotional drama, and heartbreak in your free time, throw this on!",9
Not for F1 fans,"Amazing drama!!Formula 1 season 1 2018:
1. Felt bad for esteban when he was removed , sergio was taken.2. Rich lance stroll
3. Huge fan of Riccardo this season after his win in monaco. Everybody was putting money on Max Versteppan .4. Redbull-renault rivalry
6. Grosjean HAAS thoke hi ja raha tha😂
7. Charles leclerc - ferrari dream, very youngg!! Mental power amazing, 48 hours after his father's death, he won!!8. Max verstappen and esteban pushing incident.9.mercedes ferrari stayed out of S1- rn my opinion is 'rich teams'
10. I loved Daniel, Felt bad for esteban, loved leclerc
11. Daniel moving to Renault.12. Force India was actually doing good until mallya was taken- read mallya's case in detail
13 Alonso got retired.14. Hamilton 5 times champion!Formula 1 season 2 2019:
1. Gasly-alex torro rosso <>red bull
2. Anthoine hubert died in formula 2. Number 19 retired in honor
3. CRAZY Brazil race. Pierre gasly 2nd , his first ever race. Carlos Jr moved from 20 to 3rd position, alex albon was moved away by lewis hamiltonCarlos Jr became my favorite and red bull fav team mainly because of the principal. (That renault-redbull fight). Carlos is a silver spoon kid, but still very mature and hard-working. Worked SO hard to prove himself, worked so hard after getting removed from renault. Mclaren's position was entirely changed by him'",10
Ridiculous comedy show,Very well made. Good shots and put together to build nice story and introduction of the drivers. It's a shame that Mercedes and Ferrari didn't participate but that gave more time for the battles further back. Recommended to others to watch,8
Excellent,"As many others have said, even if you're not a die-hard motorsports fan its definitely worth watching. Well written, researched and produced, it's fascinating and complerely binge-worthy. I loved getting to k ow the drivers, teams and the challenges and I really liked how each episode focused on different teams/drivers. Really hope they make a second series!",10
Brilliant,Haven't been a huge fan of F1 but after watching these doc series it got my attention.,9
Fascinating look behind the scenes of Formula 1,"But not once the suffering and certain death of Stoffel Vandoorne at McLaren in it. Shows the heavy political F1 influence on the series. And misses out the essence of its title ""drive to survive"".",10
A must watch at any fan level !!,Why we are forced to see the unnecessary commentary. F1 has already commentator like crofty and bundle . Why the formula e commentator is added unnecessary.,7
"Great to watch, but...",Didn't know Netflix had done a docu-series on F1. Binge watched the first series and absolutely loved it. Hasten to say now finished season 2. It's a must for any die hard F1 fan.,4
Brilliant,"I have never watched any of the F1 races before ,only know few famous F1 racer showed up in the TV news from time to time, but after watched this show I could feel the excitement and expectation in this F1 racing world! It's a great show for people knowing nothing about F1 to enjoy and become day one as a F1 fan!",10
"Great Storyline, but not a wide enough range on all drivers!!",Fell out of love with F1 for a few years but this summary of the 2018 season is superb. It explains what happens off and on the track that is enthralling even for those uninterested in F1. I really hope Netflix do this after each season.Thanks to this show I'm back on the F1 hype.,8
I'm hooked,"I don't watch F1 but gave the 1st episode a go. It is really great and accessible, and the 4K is nice.",10
"Season 1&2 ok, season 3 not that great",I have watched all. I'll keep watch next seasons until it'll removed on broadcasting. But I can not stop asking without myself. What was the reason season 3 that much disappointing. Corona? Maybe... But previous seasons were much more better! No doubt! F1 raceses does not consist just HAAS team! F1 is not just drama and stop to catch up American audiences for it,9
"Sheeew, boom, swoooosh, braaaam, bang, swish, wooooooooong......",Really enjoyable. Hope they will continue year on year!,9
Restored My Passion in Formula1,"I absolutely loved watching this series. I've started losing interest in F1 few years ago to the point I would only read a news here and there in 2018. This series returned the fire for the Formula 1. I was mesmerized from the first episode and can't wait to watch the next race in China.
Having Merc and Ferrari opted out was not necessarily a bad thing as it gave more space for other teams and drivers you generally don't know much about. With 2019 season having youngest grid in a long time, looking forward to season 2.",10
Disappointing 4th season,"Sergio Perez is one of the best pilots in F1, since its arrival to Force India in 2015, he has beaten his team partner, in 2015 and 2016 he scored more points than Niko Hulkenberg, in 2017 and 2018 he definitively beat Ocon by far (in 2017 Checo scored 100 points, Ocon only 87... in 2018 Checo scored 62 points, Ocon only 49); it is sad to see how Netflix shows an arrogant and non-profesional Sergio when he is by far a much better driver than the dangerous Ocon, in addition Checo has a strong support and sponsorship from Carlos Slim; why would Force India (now Racing Ponit) not chose Sergio over Ocon? they made the best and logical decision... and Netflix expressed disappointment because of the humble origins of Ocon, not fair, I am very disappointing... This production is not objective and only express a small group of interests.",9
"Addicting, Brilliant, Edge of your seat adrenaline rush!","Why all the focus on Hass? This would be a much better series if they brought more of the drivers in and focused on them. They completely ignored some of the greatest stories in F1. Its still a good watch, it could be better.",10
WOW: From Someone Who Has Never Heard of F1,Clueless & biased.F1's youtube channel has far better coverage than this sorry excuse of a show.What is supposed to be a clusterf... caused by FIA's decisions all through the 2021 season was portrayed in this doc painting Redbull as the villains. I mean even Toto Wolff embraced being the real villain when he appeared in he final scene wearing black turtleneck & everything.,7
Perfect drama,"Amazing vortex that pulls you right in to the game. Even if you are not a fan of the sport you will become one. Good job people keep it up. And if you are a petrolhead. Never miss this incredible series, a tale of true stories and a clear insight of the fastest motor sport of our time. Lastly, I have to state again that there has to be an episode in between races, every year from now on.",4
Excellent - will look forward to next years one,"This is a depiction of the world championship in such a way that general audience can understand what's going on in the background. There may be some exaggeration s occasionally, but those are only for dramatization purposes, don't expect a 100% technically accurate presentation, because it's not for nerdy fans out there. It's to generate new fanbase for the sport and I must say Netflix is very much successful on this occasion.",9
Loved it!,"Drive to Survive' is gritty, real, and a great look into the business side of Formula 1. If you kind of like racing, but don't know anything and wan't to get a good look behind the scenes, this series is for you.And, ladies, the drivers are all young, charismatic and, generally, great looking!I never followed racing, but after the first season I started becoming interested in Formula 1. The great thing is that this show isn't about the winners. It is about the struggles of being a Formula 1 team and the pressure faced by the drivers. Last year there was nothing from Mercedes or Ferrari so I assume they refused to be a part of the series. Well, I guess their drivers were like, ""Why aren't we on this show?"". So, in the second season, both Mercedes and Ferrari are ""enthusiastic"" participants.",10
Most intense F1 doc,This show brings you into the world of the racers and the sequences are unlike anything I have seen. Great show!,9
Drive to survive? Where is Stoffel Vandoorne than,"I have no idea how Netflix pulled this off, all I can say is the have outdone themselves with the photography, interviews, but most importantly they gave an amazing story.After this show I have less than ZERO % respect for Christian Horner, and Claire Williams who I didn't care for at all has gotten so much respect from me... I really just hope other people see the same.It showed how the weekends work, how much pressure the team bosses put on themselves and how important fairness is, it showed how teams can collapse because of one person's arrogance (Verstappen) and how other teams can grow because of the humility of one person (Steiner).All in all a must see if you are a Formula 1 fan.",9
Unnecessary drama and commentary,"This is brilliant stuff. Short bytes of viewing (unless you binge). The back story to F1 is fascinating, exciting, shocking and thoroughly EPIC tv watching. I am a total convert.",8
For Anyone who is an F1 fan,"Absolutely phenomenal , just downloaded F1 app this show makes me a big fan now , story behind is just masterpiece well done Netflix.",9
A new F1 fan after the show,"This show is geared more towards people that are new to F1 than long time fans. Found it a bit boring, over-dramatized, and had some annoying sound editing issues (audio goes from barely audible to loud at times). It's also a shame that Mercedes and Ferrari barely participated in the documentary.Great for new fans, probably not overly interesting for current fans, production could have been better.",10
Superb,"Unfortunately, it doesn't represent reality to Netflix, but adds its own stuff or mixes the facts to increase viewership and drama in the events. It would be fitting to adapt to F1 and present events that are taking place and not what may or may not be ...",10
Really great for someone who doesn't watch F1,Wants to make you watch more and get excited about upcoming races.,7
All good except season 3,"I was never interested in F1, watched this documentary and that changed. You really get to know F1 on such a different level. Absolutely loved watching this and hope there's gonna be more!",1
Great stuff,"I was very disapointed about F1 events, everything is dull comparing to MotoGP. I was watching F1 back in the past, now I cannot say who won last years championship. Saying this I give a 10/10 to this show, because I ve started to like F1 again",10
"Skipped the 2018 season, not skipping 2019! All thanks to this series","Being mildly familiar with F1 racing, this made me a huge fan. Remarkably dramatic, enticing... has it all. More more more please. A terrific use of time.",8
Sad to see how Netflix team changed reality,"From the time that I started to watch season 1 my respect for Formula One racing grew to the heavens! It just amazes me about just how much time and effort and teamwork goes into this business. I am simply in awe of the every aspect of this incredible sport.
As with this show, I'm quite happy with the way is to put together. I can imagine it is quite difficult to cram in a whole Formula One season into just a handful of episodes. I really enjoy the cinematography of this show. They really to well to get you all bumped up for each race to start. I like how they start out highlighting the three main day of each Grand Prix. From the practice day to the qualifying day to race day it's so cool to feel like you are being a part of the story and team that the show features for that episode. I would HIGHLY recommend this show to anyone!
I cannot WAIT for the 2020 season!!",10
"An entertaining series, but....","I enjoyed both seasons. Some behind the scenes material is perfect for getting ready for the next season. But with the virus delays, I wish they could package up some cutting room floor material into another episode or two. Even if it is not good I would watch.",10
Clueless & biased.,"You came to the right place. Visually and story driven mini series that takes a look behind the scenes of F1, it's drivers, their lives, polictics and how every little or big action affects everything. It's a must watch for someone who knows a lot about F1 and for someone who wants to find out more. Waiting for season 2.
The series very raw, real and it makes me feel about them. It's a cut throat bussines in which everyone is trying to succeed. I love it.",10
There has to be an episode after every race,"Awesome series. Watching the races is a thing. But seing ""insiders"" is awesome.Good thing they have Ferrari and Merc on S2.",9
Not for nerds,"First couple of episodes is about Ricciardo. Is it Daniel to survive, as he joked or drive to survive? It covered all English drivers (Nando, Russell and Ham) but nothing about Alonso, Vettel. Distorted real events. Ocon's first place in Hungary shown without any help of Alonso keeping Ham behind, Russell puncture in Bahrain 2020 but not shown colossal mess up in the pitsopts with tires. Bottas soft approach to block couple of Max passes after he lost contract to Merc. Nothing about sprint races. The episodes are 30-40 minutes, too short. It should be one episode per race. It was edited like Big brother or Survior.",10
f1 fans += 1,"If you not an F1 fan this will make good documentary (it's not really a documentary) viewing of the behind the scenes of an F1 season.If you are a fan, this the missing channel of a race weekend, fills in gaps of the things that we speculatively talk about.Nicely edited, also doubles up a condensed recap of 2018 season.To all participants, great job!",10
Great insider view of Formula 1 racing!,"Wow. I didn't think they can top every season, but they do. Anyways, that's my personal opinion and I will talk about the series now.Drive to survive is captivating. It is engaging which makes your emotions be affected, you start relating to drivers. This is how Sports coverage MUST be done when formatting it as drama (I wouldn't call it documentary since it recaps the previous year's season in more of a Drama format, albeit there are a lot of interviews like a documentary ). Also, you learn a lot about the mechanics behind the F1 business. It teaches you the economics behinds decision making.Most interesting thing is that they use every episode to focus on a person/ team. So a couple of episodes takes you through the same timeline but from different perspectives and I seriously applaud the idea and it's execution.",6
Amazing,"I know last season of F1 was phenomenal and mind blowing in every aspect but I admit, watching this show gives me the same if not more thrill than watching the entire F1 season live. Netflix team's done a very very good job so far.",2
"Brilliant, and mind changing",This is exhilarating from start to finish. I really like how it showcased many of the battles going on further down the field and the fight they face to become a top team. It's really well filmed and edited and captures all of the drama of an F1 season. Well done Netflix!,10
Knew nothing about F1. Now I want to know everything,A fantastic behind the scenes that goes beyond what you watch during a race. It brought a while new understanding of the competition beyond the Mercedes/Ferrari drama.,10
Phenomenal,"I have always enjoyed F1, less in the previous years as it hasnt been as excisting as it was before but I still watch highlights of the every race.When I started watching this series, I got hooked instantly. Seeing how the teams work, drivers feel and have pressure, ups n dows was just so interesting. Definitely a series to watch even if you are not a F1 fan.",10
"Aimed at new viewers, some minor production issues","This is a really well made documentary series. It really engages you in the different teams and the different drivers. The way they have directed it also gives you the whole circle of entertainment. It is exciting, it is humorous, it is serious and it leaves you wondering what will happen next. I am really hoping for a season 3 even though the Formula 1 season for 2020 have been a lot different.I highly recommend you watching this. My fiance, who are not into F1, enjoyed it as much as me.",10
Lots of lies and artificial drama,"Honestly, I never knew much or cared for F1 before this show. I thought it was basically NASCAR, but on a more global scale. I was very wrong. In this series, you get an in-depth look at the cars, drivers, races, etc. as well as some behind the scenes action. It is extremely well done. Since I first started watching last year, I have followed F1 much closer and plan on going to a few live events in the near future.",10
Perfect for an f1 fan or you want to get into it,"Very engaging series for non F1 fans!
It focuses mainly on the relationship aspects in the teams and the rivalry between the pilots, so it gives good insights about the F1 world and the dynamics between the teams and drivers. It's interesting to see how you'd find yourself rooting for some drivers and not being a fan of others in the end.If the objective of the series is to attract more F1 fans and get you hooked, then it delivers 100% on it.",10
Suprisingly amazing,"Season 1 and 2 was the pinnacle , but season 3 is just a hit and a miss .Nothing about the turkish Gp and lewis hamilton . i am glad i watched all the races live so i can miss this season of drive to survive , really nothing much going on just drama drama and drama. Better watch the F1 youtube channel it has much better content",10
This show make me interested in F1 again,"When Hamilton leaves no space, it's Verstappens fault. When Verstappen leaves no space it's Verstappens fault. The incident at Imola is depicted to be so much more dangerous than Silverstone. Hamiltons penalty was the longes 10-seconds I've e ever seen where as Max's grid-penalty wasn't even mentioned. Toto blaming Red Bull for whining? Really? Merc throwing so much s*** on Max and Christian this season. I can go on and on.",8
Terrific..,"Afetr those 2 seasons, I really want to pay for F1 subscription so I can watch F1 again.",7
EDGE OF YOUR SEAT!!!,Amazing insight into behind the scenes of the formula one teams and the pressures they are put under. Stunning Cinematography throughout the series and will reignite your love for F1 for any fleeting fan. Bring on season 3.,4
Enjoyed Both seasons,"It is very intersting series, there is a lot of excitement and thrill, but in the second season I think making episodes shorter was not good idea, there were not that much details in each episode like season 1. Also, in season 2 it was so focused in limited number of teams even though there were teams that I think we were anticipating to get some highlight, like Renault with their new driver signing, seasen 2 did not focus in this topic even though many fans were excited about the new signing.",10
Want to appréciate F1 more while watching ?,Nice to see a show that not only highlights the top teams but the Mid Level Teams and the Race within the Race. This is a very up close and personal look into the Fastest and Most Expensive Motorsport on Planet Earth. Beautiful cinematography and brilliant colour the production team did a Great Job putting it all together. The highs and the lows of a season from the people most effected by the circumstances. I'm really looking forward to Season 2. This is a MUST WATCH for race fans World Wide.,9
If you are an F1 fan. This is a MUST WATCH.,"George Floyd and BLM? Really?THAT was a HUGE bitter pill on what was otherwise 3 great seasons of behind the F1 racing drivers and teams.Any more of this and we're dumping Netflix, only got it to watch this series...Do you homework WITHOUT using a search engine that manipulates its results that fits a narrative...",10
"Could Be Greatly Improved, Here's How...","When watcing this movie, you may feel that you are playing a video game. Just awesome. Recommended to game lover.",10
"From season 1 to season 4, it lost 5 stars","I have been an f1 fan since forever but this docuseries is like none before.
It shows everything about this expensive sports from politics to rivalry between teams and even between teammates. It also gives you a better idea about all the drivers, their backgrounds and struggles in reaching this ultimate sport.
I haven't started season 2 yet but season 1 is already keeping me in front of the screen for hours.",10
F1 RAW,"The only thing missing is George's glorious first time winning points in F1 weekend. Awesome job, Netflix 👍",10
Sports Drama Done Right!,"Well everyone knows that Max verstappen didn't want to do his interviews in DTS because he thinks that they fake a lot of drama and create false rivalries.As a response it seems that drive to survive are portraying max as the biggest bully/villain on earth in season 4 and everything he does is bad prime examples are episode 3 and 9 and the only exemption in which max seems like a decent human being is episode 10. On the other hand they show lewis and Mercedes as heroes without criticizing any actions of them because they ""win on track"" and never do anything bad. Finally the same bias they have against Max they seem to have against the whole red bull team.",10
Absolutely brilliant!,"I am not a F1 fan.
This series is not about F1 crashes, I was expecting that.
It is more about drivers nearing end of their contrancts, and teams, some struggling other trying to catch up with big boys.
Now I feel groomed to watch or at least follow next season of F1.
Hope netflix will do another series about next season.",9
Wow - a must watch,Excellent show absolutely loved it. Not just about the racing but what it takes to get one of the 20 seats. A lot of insight into what goes on behind the scenes.Really hope they make another season,6
Amazing!,"This is amazing, a scripted show that parades itself as a reality/documentary. Thus, virtually no coverage of the great ending to the 21-22 ending because that would be a buzz kill for us rubes. We get no info on the teams and the technology, just on the drivers, just like astronauts and this is more than awesome because it raises money for Netflix and F1, as now we have 3 races in the US, it's money money money and all the reluctant teams have now been forced to participate in the show.And what's not to like? Yachts, pretty people, private jets, 500-700 million dollar budgets and Chris Horner, country gentleman, envious, punching down, pure CIS testosterone, and we're all happy with that, well, I am, anyway, have no idea why, maybe it seems stranger to me than the dark side of the moon, or 30,000 feet down in the Marianas trench. This is why humans are amazing and humans suck, all this wealth and wealth related activity and amazing technology and creativity and the children driving the cars, as if they have a clue what this is all about.I particularly love all the shots of the 500 foot cruise ships in the distance as the $500,000 launches casually ferry the talent. And to be clear, this is zero sum, all the money being sucked into wealth is sucked away from everyone else, there is no real argument to the contrary, just wealth, to the extent it even matters to them, sputtering crap to justify themselves. And, in terms of the US, Steinbeck said it best, ""there are no poor in the US, just embarrassed, temporary millionaires"" Humans, we're fools and WWIII is nigh, as it has always been.",4
"I havent binged a whole season before in one day, now I have","Adrenaline blend with Emotions, is what you got in this series. Great Shoot, Behind The Scene and Feel, 10 eps is not enough. But, this series is to much focus in 5 standing team, hopefully, more teams covered is best we can get.",10
Get your adrenaline going,We see behind the scenes of almost all F1 constructors apart from Alpha Romeo and Alpha Tauri. We see emotions running high and tension between teams & teammates. How hard it is to survive in F1 example ocon & hulkenberg. Hulkenberg part where Renault doesn't renew his contract is heartbreaking. And of course Mercedes 1min pit stop. Haas frustrations. Red Bull youth program. Ricciardo ditching Red bull. Waiting for season 3 episode of monza where Gasly won the race.,10
Never been interested in F1 until this show.,"I'm not a huge fan of F1 as I don't watch the races, but I do watch many documentaries and movies on F1 and racing in general. This mini series is truly well done. I like that we follow less known and sometime underdog teams. It's a breath of fresh air. I just hate it all here in matters of days. It was so good. Really looking for season 2.",9
Entertaining!,"This series is jam packed with action, danger and drama! A must see for people who love shows that show all the behind the scenes politics. This series shows that F1 isn't just another testosterone driven sport with men taking ""another left turn""!",10
Season 3 is Not that Great,"The first seasons were great, but season 4 didn't show us some of the best and most exciting parts of the 2021 season. They should stop focusing on only one team per episode. Gets boring...",9
Is this show made by the Brits?,"Turned F1 into WWE. Netflix revenue and similar, extreme profit-driven motivations have taken F1 from a sport to a reality show. If I want to watch a fictional series I'll choose Friends or Curb Your Enthusiasm, way more fun. Hard pass.",10
GREAT!!!,"This is a brilliant series. You get to see glimpses of what really goes on behind the scenes. Drivers, teams, owners and crews emotions, up and downs and even up close and personal to some of their private lives. Also what really goes into operating a team, costs, logistics etc etc.If you love F1 then this series is must.",9
Stunning Cinematography For Any Sports Fan,"Im not a hard core F1 fan, but after the first episode I could not leave it alone.
If there is any show I hope comes back for a second season, this is the one. Absolutley fantastic! 11/10",10
It definitely made me so intrested in F1,"One of the best serial ever
Amazing, well done
1000/10",6
Great inside look into Racing,"Great show produced by Netflix! It does not hide the things the teams would like to be behind closed doors. No love between some drivers in the same team, which we already knew, but seeing it it's even better. Great tension, great capturing of important moments, great seeing smaller teams fighting, great music.Excellent! Bravo!",2
Last Minutes of Season 3 Last Episode...,"This show is just perfect!! Incredible well done!! Its a pitty that not all teams are on it, I think it was a very stupid mistake of them, because now we all have inclination to follow the ones thar were in the show, and by all I mean the people that didn't fallow F1 before the show, like me.Well done Netflix!!! Well done!!!!",10
Feel Like video game,"Not a single minute of the entire series feels boring. Can't think of any flaw from the technical side or the story side of it. A viewer gets sucked into the series right from the first few minutes of the first episode and there is no letting off. One get to see what happens in a F1 team. The team politics, the rivalry between the drivers, the tension and the drama when the engines are on.The makes have given the viewers something great. A sports fan will love this series to the core. A must must must watch.",10
A must x 10000000,The series is beautifully directed and edited for viewers who are new to F1 as well as hardcore F1 fans.,8
Missing GR weekend at Mercedes,"I'm absolutely hooked.This gives your everything, drama between men in politics, with money and engineering. Full disclosure behind the scene experience, nerve wrecking toe to toes, the real fight on the track and off the track. So in love with this! My adrenalin spikes from the couch corner!",9
Three season F1 commercial,"What is this, a soap opera? This series is riddled with fake rivalry, manipulated video, manipulated audio, fake and manipulated everything, just to drag in some viewers. And if that's not enough, it does all that while missing the real tension, the real action and everything else that makes F1 great.What a disgrace. Perhaps you should hire Michael Bay to direct season 5.",8
Season 4 is poor and biased,"I loved this show, I can finally understand, what Formula1 is all about!I found it interesting though, how proud many of the drivers and team principals seemed to be to abuse the Netflix teams and their reporters - which doesn't seem to be particularly daring because I doubt that Netflix employee is at liberty to say something back or come out behind the camera to have an even clearer word with you. The way I see it, these journalists are just doing their jobs and I'm sure that Netflix is paying good money to the teams and contributes to paying their salaries. You don't want Netflix there? Fine. But if you agree to let them document your sport treat them with some decency.",8
Amazing series,I think I have found a new favorite in this recurring series based on one of the most competitive & entertaining sporting events of the world - Formula 1. I came in knowing nothing about the sport and now suddenly feel like I have to track everything that happens in this sport & it's players. It's an amazing series and I love the unfiltered behind the scenes conversations & reactions that really make you fall in love with the entire process of the game. I thoroughly enjoyed it!,10
You don't have to be an F1 fan to love this show,Great show! You should involve bigger teams and film everything that is happening inside the garage and on the track.,9
"rich children and rich ""adults"" whinge on",Brilliant stuff here. A must watch! My girlfriend even loved it and she doesn't care too much for motorsports. You get an insight in to what's going through the minds of these lunatics and everyone thats something in this business as they batlle their way through the season. Would have liked to see ferrari and mercedes in this as well but I hope they'll open up next season. Loved it.,6
"Great DocuSeries, Recomended!",As a F1 fan I had to watch the show. I guess there are areas that could have been explored deeper but over all the show works. Personally I would have liked to learn more about the sacrifices a F1 pilot has to make in areas like mental and physical training.,1
How different F1 can be as a sport,"Before watching this during lockdown '20 , my teenage sons and I were neutral towards F1. I'd frequently watch the highlights and occasionally a whole race. My lads didn't even do that. Now 2/3 of us watch every race and we also have a playseat and PS4 pro set up just for setting F1 laptimes in competition with each other.A series that changes actual behaviours is a rare thing indeed. It works by applying high production values whilst capturing the emotions of drivers, owners and support staff too. The race captures are excellent and then balance of on-track and off-track footage is perfect in terms of setting the scene and drawing the viewer in to the action.In this context the 'woke segment' and the end of S3 is forgiven also because by putting it at the end, these viewers could simply turn it off and avoid it. Good job The 'Flix!",9
Outstanding production,"I've been an F1 fan for twenty five years, so the prospect of this series was exciting. It fell flat, almost like Liberty Media paid for a extended promo. It could have been great, I don't think it was thought through enough. I'm not entirely sure anyone who hasn't watched F1 will bother to watch it.",10
I. WANT. MORE.,"I am a huge F1 fan, and I have followed the sport for a long time, but this show is so bad, it has so many good moments, but for some reason, they falsify so many incidents. Put dialogue over the wrong moments, making best friends and buddies seem like they hate each other. It's absolutely absurd, and ruins the sport.",10
"This Series has brought me back to Formula 1, Thanks Netflix !","This show has done wonders for a sport which was losing spectators. F1 is as much about what is happening off track as on it. DTS Gets you hooked on to the off track drama, negotiations, rivalries, personalities, and everything in between.An absolute master stroke by Liberty Media and Netflix.",10
Disappointing season 4,I remember when I watched Senna years ago why I wasn't into f1. his show is done so beautifully. I really hope it gets picked up for a 3rd season as I will be following the 2020 season. I might even try to make it to Austin this year.,10
Nope,"I am in the middle of Season 3 and I undestand that Hole season cannot be described in 10 series, as a begginer I was amazed, but at the end of last(3rd) season I am dissapointed I want to know more details))... Ty for introduction.Right now I have to add some words to describe my opinion, but this revis was the shortest way not to spoiler, but thank the creators for the great introduction to F1...",10
Eye Opener,"Amazing work by Netflix. Love the editing, the storytelling and i can't even think the hard work they put in this.
You will know the BTS of Formula 1 , what's behind it, the money, the bosses, the fans, the technology, the politics and the drivers.After this doc you will have at least four favourite drivers that you will cheer at every race just so they can make 1 point.",10
Fantastic show!,Flawlessly produced. A documentary what will certainly draw new fans to this fantastic motor sport. Really hope that 2019 season is in the scope for another documentary like this.,10
Amazing,Eine Fortsetzung für die Saison 2019 wäre ein Genuss!,6
Excellent,"If you are you looking for a good ""prequel"" of 2019 championship, you can find it here. Great series that focus on young and prominent teams (or not so prominent).",1
Perfect!! Im a F1 fan now!!,"The first two episodes weren't fantastic, but it definitely picks up from there after they stop obsessing over Red Bull. Good to learn so much about the other drivers and teams that don't usually get too much coverage",10
Gripping and Excellent to say the least.,"The sport is exciting enough without all of the artificial rivalries and drama Netflix pumps in. No wonder a majority of the drivers don't want to participate anymore. Max won the championship last season, but since he didn't want to be involved after the BS narrative they gave him in season one, they pretty much just focus on Mercedes.. or Toto and Horner. DTS is just a F1 reality TV show for people that don't actually watch the races.",8
Well directed and explained the ground realities in F1,"I have binged this series non-stop! It even made me watch a F1 race for the first time! This documentary is very well made, every episode tells a different story. Every one of them is very intriguing, exciting and interesting. Can't wait till next season (and next race ;-) )!",10
Thrilling,"Started watching it out of the blue and man I have not been disappointed. The series is a perfect mixture of thrilling action that defines F1 while sneaking behind the scenes to showcase the politics, pressure behind the glamour and fame. An absolute must watch for any sports fan and I can guarantee this series will increase the viewership of F1 for years to come.",10
"Not good, not bad, but also not representitive","As an avid F1 fan I binge watched all 10 episodes of this brilliant documentary in a single weekend, but even if you only have a casual interest in the sport, it will show you a whole new side to the rivalry that goes on in the sport, not only between teams but also between teammates. I saw it in a whole new light as the race coverage at the track on a race weekend is all about what happens in front of the camera, this documentary crew were filming reaction behind the scenes and they did a great job. Only pity was that obviously Ferrari and Mercedes declined to be involved.",10
Fake and insincere reality show that's not about racing,"Great series, gave me one more reason to love F1. I can feel the current running down my veins while watching this series.",9
"Great show, arrogant teams","This is a brillant work of patchwork narrative structure. I can't imagine how hard it is to build this kind of storytelling, but what this show is doing is simply brilliant!I do not watch F1 races. It bores me and I don't know much about it. But in a sense, this show is not about that. It is about humans who do what they dream of in a world of big money, politics, back-stabbing, sharks, huge and terrifying challenges at every race.This is insane and wonderfully told, often suggested. This is high art and masterful storytelling. Try it. It doesn't matter if you like F1 racing. This is just crazy.",8
Fast! Thrilling! Touching!,This is homework for every wannabe F1 fan or hardcore F1. The photography is the best I have ever seen.Even if you have never watched F1 this will entertain you and possibly hook you.I am a female and I also love the eye candy.,9
The missing piece of F1,Even directed Netflix series will have less drama than the actual thing im guessing. What happened 2021 on the grid was unbeliveble... Cant wait for the new episodes.P. S. I know whose fans wont like the new episodes :),6
Great show!,"As Stefano Domenicali says in one of the episodes, his job is to maximize value of F1. Season 4 does literally that much more than previous seasons. They go through the season misplacing voice clips and radios to create artificial drama in a season that already contained enough drama, though that drama makes F1 looks bad for multiple reasons. They don't even mention race in Spa and go through the s**t fest of Abu Dhabi in very uncritical way. If you've watched every race of the season, then this won't provide any value whatsoever.",5
More please!,I really enjoyed and like the fact that it's about everything that happens in motorsport and teams behind races.,9
Could have gone deeper.,If you like shows like Hard knocks this will be a hit.It really shows how the sport is about a lot more than just fast drivers. The drivers and chiefs are mostly in focus which is as it should be but a little more depth about the crews would´ve been nice.The racing is somewhat exaggerated because they take all incidents from a race and stack them together but a real racing fan knows that´s not how a 60 lap race looks.The only negative is that none of the four top drivers is participating if you don´t count in passing. Of course I can see the difficulty in getting them to do it but that is how you get a 10 rating...,10
Superb fly on the wall documentary. Disappointing woke end to S3,"After watching the first two seasons of the show, it has to be said that the Netflix team did a nice job picking interesting storylines dealing with drivers and bosses as the go through their paces in a season. These give a great backdrop to the drama unfolding on the race tracks itself.
On the other hand, I felt that the show could possible have more continuity in terms of moving race to race and having the season results in context too. Currently, each episode has its own timeline which does not give the viewers much context w.r.t to the ongoing season.1 - (8 Sept 20)",10
Getting better all the time,"Thoroughly enjoyable series about the going-ons in F1 racing. Netflix found a way to give a human face to the politics, arrogance and uncompromising nature of this sport.I have become a fan of Daniel Ricciardo in the process and will be rooting for Magnussen this year and hope Ocon gets the Ferrari seat soon.",10
I really wanted to like this,Absolutely fantastic TV series of F1 and some of the drivers including their family life. Wonderfully edited story that makes you feel part of the action. Try one episode and you will be hooked!,10
Overdramatised dogturd,"On the one hand this show has its flaws. Most people are aware of them. Wrong quotes from wrong years, forced story lines and fake rivalries, etc.Nonetheless, it's entertaining to watch.So entertaining in fact, that after watching the first season I became a fan of F1, watch every race and know more about it than I ever thought I would. Enough to now know the flaws and deceptions of this show.In the end it's the best marketing F1 ever had. And I still watch it after season and am excited to see what they made out of the last season.",10
Hooked me on to F1 once again!,A documentary that gives unique insight into what happens behind the scenes in F1. Watch it!!,10
Doc series you don't want to miss,"Eveey season is worth watching. Though, if youre a real fan of formula 1, you will see a big change in season 3. Theres a microscope onto the political aspects on the formula 1 and not so much on the races and teams as in the first seasons. Because of this, i was pretty much dissapointed in the latest season. For example, The 'underdog' teams as Williams are not shown as much, and also, the big impact of the corona virus on the sports is not as detailed as it should be. The big statement Formula 1 made in #Weraceasone and Black Lives Matter dont even get any attention. Litteraly 1 sentance is made in the series about this. I wouldve expect more from Netflix to make a statement that this sport is not about race. Netflix makes it look like its business as usual after the shut down, which is not the case. I miss a lot of detailed info like crashes or car malfaction in some races and why some teams made it to podium. Maybe im micromanaging but i just miss a lot more information wich was not the case in previous seasons.",10
First time I make a review,"One big pro-Hamilton show. Very one sided view of the events that happend during the most exciting F1 year ever.Interviews and quotes are taken out of context to create situations that never happend, atleast nog in thuis wat.",6
This doc will make you fall in love with F1,"I watched this after my daughter, a non licensed mid 20, totally uninterested in motosports recommended it. She lives next to the Melbourne F1 track and went in 2019, after watching this and was a convert. My wife also similarly uninterested in motosport is now a convert. Me, I was a motosport fan for ages (even owned my own car), then drifted away as it became a little hum drum, but this has given me a new perspective. An inside line into the daily dramas of managing, driving, racing in motosport. So much so, I may even plan a holiday to Melbourne for Grand Prix weekend just for the hell of it. Something I never thought I would ever do. For me and my wife, one of the better aspects of this is that we have been to many of the locations where the races are run so a nostalgic flood of memories is a hit.I recommend this to anyone who is interested in knowing more about F1, fan or not, this is not just about the race, its so much more.",1
